# Tennis Collaboration/Competition Project



## Introduction
In this project 2 agents will be trained to play tennis. Each agent recieves 0.1 reward for every time that the agent is able to hit the ball over the net and not out of bounds. If the ball goes out of band or the agent let the ball hit the ground the agent recieves a reward of -0.01.

The observation space space consists of 24 different states for each agent which consists of position and velocity of the ball and the racket. For the action space there are two continous actions between -1 and +1 that corresponds to moving back and forth and jumping.

In the below gif we can see the 20 different agents and their arms and their respective target zones.

If no time step restriction is set the agent will run for about 1000 timesteps before terminating.
 
The target for the agents is to achieve a rolling reward over 100 episodes of 30 or more of an average of all the agents.

## Getting Started
1. For setting up the python environment follow the instructions in this link:
https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies

2. Download the environment from one of the links below. You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

* Linux: click here
* Mac OSX: click here
* Windows (32-bit): click here
* Windows (64-bit): click here

3. Place the file in the repo.

4. The following libraries need to imported in order to run all the cells in the notebook
* UnityEnvironment from unityagents  
* numpy  
* random  
* namedtuple and deque from collections  
* torch  
* matplotlib
* import pickle
* pandas
* copy

## Instructions
To run the agent in the environment and using the different methods one just have to sequantially execute the cells in the notebook. 

The function "ddpg" runs the training phase of the networks if nothing else is specified it will for 400 episodes. Before this function is run one also needs to instatiate the StoreResults class which helps with saving some results from the run. In addition the Agent has to be instatiated as well before running the training function.

If one wants to use the pretrained network that accomplist the target of achieve +30 reward over all agents for a rolling mean over 100 episodes the file "checkpoint_actor.pth" as to be loaded.

Files in the repo:
* Continuous_Control.ipynb (Notebook for running and training the agents)
* checkpoint_actor.pth (Saved weights for the actor network)
* checkpoint_critic.pth (Saved weigts for the critic network)
* file.pkl (Saved different model configurations and resuts)
